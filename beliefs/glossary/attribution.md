# attribution

**In this brain:** the frontmatter map recording a doc's **ingestion event** — how it came to be in the bundle, as opposed to what it says or when it last changed. Every bundle concept and governance doc carries one, with fixed sub-keys: `when` (the ingestion instant), `channel` (the pathway — a controlled vocabulary: `intake`/`auto-intake`/`glossary`/`agent-authored`/`backfill`), `agent` (the acting pathway, named not by model but by route), `why` (one sentence on why it was worth filing), and — on governance docs only — `from`, a back-link to the thread or concept it was extracted from.

It is an **event** record, so it does not change: the event sub-keys are write-once, and the governance `from` is [append-only](/beliefs/glossary/append-only.md) (feature lineage accretes as later sessions revise a doc). This is what distinguishes it from the three neighbouring fields it is deliberately orthogonal to — [`resource`](/beliefs/glossary/single-source-of-truth.md) (*what asset*), [`provenance`](/beliefs/glossary/provenance.md) (*where the content came from*, possibly predating the brain), and `timestamp` (*when it last changed*). It is not a competing change-log either: the commit graph stays the single change narrative, and attribution is the one in-band summary of the ingestion commit that renames, merges, and portable-bundle consumption otherwise make hard to recover. Enforced by `mix brain.verify` (shape, `from` resolution, exemption placement, presence) and defined by the [resource-attribution policy](/meta/policy/resource-attribution.md).

Because `when` is the ingestion instant, it doubles as the brain's **created-date** signal — the counterpart of [`timestamp`](/beliefs/glossary/timestamp.md)'s semantic modified-date (it breaks same-day ties when the governance indexes order entries by recency; see the [collection-view-by-date plan](/meta/plans/collection-view-by-date.md)).
