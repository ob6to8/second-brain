- **The repo root is the OKF bundle.** Concepts live at the root and in
  subdirectories. `.claude/` (skills), `meta/` (governance), the Elixir tooling
  (`mix.exs`, `lib/`, `test/`), and `deprecated/` (archived legacy content,
  read-only) sit alongside but are **not** part of the knowledge bundle.
- **A concept** is a single UTF-8 markdown file with two parts:
  1. **YAML frontmatter** (required), delimited by `---`.
  2. **Markdown body** (distilled prose; no required sections).
- **Concept ID** = file path minus `.md` (e.g. `areas/health.md` → `areas/health`).
