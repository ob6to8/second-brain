OKF requires a `type` but registers no vocabulary. This bundle uses a **controlled
list** so the brain stays queryable. It **grows deliberately** — an agent may
propose a new type, but the operator ratifies additions (same as directories).

Seed vocabulary:

- `note` — a distilled idea, observation, or thought.
- `claim` — a statement **asserted but not independently verified** (track status with
  the `verified` field; may graduate to `concept` once confirmed).
- `concept` — a definition or mental model (established/accepted).
- `reference` — external material you have **captured and summarized** (article, doc,
  video, thread). A bare URL becomes a `reference` only once processed.
- `source` — a primary source citation (paper, book, dataset).
- `person` — a person.
- `project` — an active, goal-bounded effort.
- `area` — an ongoing responsibility or domain (no end state).
- `snippet` — a reusable command, code fragment, or template.
- `policy` — a governance rule for how the brain operates; the source from which
  `CLAUDE.md` is compiled (lives under `meta/policy/`).
- `tutorial` — a long-form explanatory note meant to be read start to finish (the
  "why"/"how" behind the tooling or a topic); distinct from a terse `note` and from
  a `reference` capture of external material (lives under `meta/tutorials/`).
- `issue` — a tracked operational problem, defect, or open concern about how the
  brain or its tooling/automation behaves, recorded for future reference and
  follow-up. Carries a `status` (`open`/`resolved`/`wontfix`); distinct from a
  `policy` (a rule) and a `note` (a distilled idea) — an issue is a *problem to
  track* (lives under `meta/issues/`).

If nothing fits, propose a new type rather than forcing a bad one.
