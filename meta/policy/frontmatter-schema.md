Frontmatter fields:

| Field | Requirement | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `id` | **Mandatory** (bundle concepts) | Stable opaque identifier, `sb:` + 6 hex chars. Immutable once minted (`mix brain.id`); see the identity-and-verification section. |
| `type` | **Mandatory** | From the controlled vocabulary (see the type-vocabulary section). Non-empty. |
| `title` | Strongly recommended | Human-readable display name. |
| `description` | Strongly recommended | Single-sentence summary. |
| `resource` | When applicable | URI uniquely identifying the underlying/source asset (e.g. the original URL). |
| `provenance` | When applicable | Where the content came from (e.g. "Claude Opus 4.8, chat thread"). Distinct from `resource`: this is the *origin of the statement*, not a canonical asset URI. |
| `verified` | Only on agent statements | Boolean, and **only for agent-authored statements** (`claim`/`note`/`concept`). `false` = asserted but not checked; `true` = checked and backed by a non-empty `verified_by`. **Omit** on captures — a concept that stores a link (`resource`) is not verifiable. Default `false` for AI-generated statements. |
| `verified_by` | When verified via evidence | Inline YAML list of stable ids (typically `source` captures) that jointly support this statement; targets must **exist** (they need not themselves be `verified`). The only committed representation of evidence edges. |
| `tags` | Recommended | YAML list of categorization strings. |
| `timestamp` | Recommended | ISO 8601 datetime of last meaningful change. |

Arbitrary extra keys are allowed and must be preserved.
