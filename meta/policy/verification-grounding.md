title: Verification grounding
description: Provenance is immutable history; verification applies only to agent-authored statements (never to link-storing captures), verified:true requires verified_by evidence whose targets need only exist, and verification prose is derived, never committed.

- **Provenance and verification are orthogonal.** `provenance` records where a
  statement came from and is **immutable history** — verifying a statement never
  rewrites its provenance.
- **Verification is only for agent-authored statements.** `verified: true` applies
  to a statement the agent distilled from a thread (a `claim`, `note`, or `concept`)
  and asserts it has been **checked against evidence**. A concept that stores a
  link — anything carrying a `resource` — is a **capture**, not a statement:
  verification is **not possible** for it, so a capture never carries `verified`
  (omit the field). `mix brain.verify` rejects `verified: true` on any concept that
  has a `resource`, and rejects a `verified` field (either value) on any type
  outside `claim`/`note`/`concept` — the statement-type restriction is
  machine-enforced, not editorial.
- **`verified: true` requires evidence, never its own link.** A verified statement
  must carry a non-empty `verified_by` pointing at the captures (and/or other
  statements) that support it. Storing a `resource` on the statement itself proves
  nothing and is disallowed. `mix brain.verify` enforces both halves.
- **Evidence edges live in `verified_by` only** — an inline list of stable ids whose
  targets must **exist**. Targets are typically `source` captures, which are *not*
  themselves `verified` — they are trusted evidence, not verified statements. Do not
  duplicate the edge list in prose: the verification narrative is **derived on
  demand** (`mix brain.evidence <id>`), never committed, so there is exactly one
  source of truth for what supports a statement.
- **Verify technical claims from primary sources.** Extract the supporting passages
  from authoritative documentation into `type: source` captures (verbatim quotes;
  `resource` = the official URL; provenance = extracted from that resource). The
  capture stores the link and text but is **not** marked `verified`. Aggregate the
  captures via `verified_by` on the claim, which flips the **claim** to
  `verified: true`. A `claim` grounded this way may graduate to `concept`.
